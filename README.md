# Task-Manager App
This is a simple web-based Task Manager application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase. The app allows users to:

Register and log in using Firebase Authentication.

Create, edit, and delete tasks, which are stored securely in Firebase Firestore.

User-specific task lists: Each user can only see their own tasks after logging in.

The Task Manager app is designed to be lightweight, responsive, and easy to use, providing a basic task management solution for personal use.
